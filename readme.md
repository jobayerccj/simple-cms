# Simple CMS

Simple CMS is developed using nodejs and mongodb. We won't say- it is a complete CMS, rather it is a very simple one. We developed some basic modules like page management, image management etc with an admin panel. We also developed a front end with simple html which fetches data using REST api. You are feel free to extend this cms. We tried to put all the necessary instructions here. 

## Demo



## CMS (Admin Panel)

You will find the admin panel in 'admin' subfolder. However, as the frontend fetches data using only REST api (using ajax), you can also move admin panel to a different folder or domain. This is totally separate from the frontend.

### Prerequisites

We used node 7.7.x and mongo db 3.4.x. We did not test other version, though probably it won't be a problem. If any one face any version related issue, let us know. We used  express js and mongoose in this node project.  

### Installing

Like all other node project, start with this command:

```
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies of the node project. If all are installed correctly, you can run project by this command (Don't forget to run mongo first by 'mongod' command):

```
node app
```

If you face some problem during installation, check troubleshoot section if it is mentioned.

### Running

Node normally assigns port 3000 or 9000. If node is running without problem, you can load the admin panel. (eg: http://localhost:3000)

First page will be login page ofcourse. 

A dummy user should be already created. Try login with this credential:

```
Email: admin@example.com
Password: 123456
```

After successful login, you will be redirected dashboard.

### Modules

We have tried to follow mvc structure in this project. We created controllers, models and views folders. You will find all the folder contains a subfolder named 'admin'. This is because our original plan didn't include REST api. We thought to develop integrated front end. Thats why we tried to separate all admin related codes in admin subfolder. Later we came up with idea of api, but kept this structure for future possible use. All the routing is done in controller. View is 

Feel free to explore demo website. This will help you to understand purpose/use of different modules. At this moment there are mainly 5 modules:

##### 1. Page Manager

Main purpose of this module is enabling admin to post/create static contents/pages. At first you have to create categories. Categories can be anything like : 'Standard Page', 'Blogs' , 'News'. This way you will be able to filter pages category wise which can be helpful to show list of posts in front end for different pages. You can also upload one image per post, might be used as a featured image.

##### 2. Image Manager

Image manager is the common module to manage all images required in the site. It's up to you how you will use it. 

At first you have to create categories. For example: 'Slideshow', 'Gallery' etc. You have to set image width and height for this category. This will be helpful to save image in correct size for each each category.

Then create album under these categories. For example, slideshow might need to be placed in home page and also other inner page like about us. So you can create two albums like 'Home' and 'About Us' and related these two to 'Slideshow' category.

Now you can upload images under each album. You can sort images by dragging them. You can also add additional data like 'Title', 'Description' for each uploaded images as sometimes we need to show image title, caption in website.

All images are uploaded in this folder: 

##### 3. Menu Manager

You can create menu from this module. 

##### 4. User Manager 

##### 5. Settings

## Frontend & REST API

We have used a sample website using a free bootstrap template to demonstrate how you can fetch data using ajax and backend REST api to prepare the site.

### Sample functions of API (simple_api.js)
